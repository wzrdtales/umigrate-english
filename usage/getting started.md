### Execute Dump

To dump your database you need first to configure your database config. If
you've done this, you can execute the following:

    $ umigrate dump

**Note:** Please notice, the user which is reading from your database needs
access to multiple databases. It's recommended to use a user with higher global
privileges, at least reading all databases as this user needs for example to 
read from the **mysql** and **information_schema** table if using **mysql** and 
also reading and writing to the diff database. 

**Important: Currently you need to create the `your_database_here_diff` manually
as this must be implemented to db-migrate. This is planned for future releases.**

Umigrate will now try to make a difference between `your_database_name` and 
`your_database_name_diff`. The `_diff` suffix gets appended automatically.
Alternatively you can append the command -d, to select the database whith which
umigrate will generate the difference.

    $ umigrate dump -d myChoosedDB

### Using Migrations
